# sling_script
 FiveM weapon sling script

# Description

This script allows players to sling their weapons to the back/front.

# Features

- Allows to customize what weapons can be used (see config.lua)
- Allows to customize if a weapon can be used only in the back or if it can be used in the front too
- The command is configurable
- Keeps weapons attachaments on "unsling"
- Keeps weapons ammo on "unsling"
- Syncronized across-network

# To-Do

- Adding weapons mag and attachaments to the object (currently i can't figure out a good way of doing it due to the coords)
- Adding keybinds to the script (currently clients can do it on their side using [console keybinds](https://cookbook.fivem.net/2020/01/06/using-the-new-console-key-bindings/)
